# Canvas modules to static Vuepress website
This repository contains all elements needed to generate a static site from a course of Canvas. For now it contains the course Information Theory 2018-2019 taught at the UvA, which can be served immediately.

# Information Theory 2018-2019
If you just want to use this repository for Information Theory, follow the following steps.
1. Clone this repository, e.g. 
`git clone https://github.com/r-hoffmann/canvas-api.git`
2. Go to the root directory of the static website and serve it, e.g. 
`cd canvas-api/docs/.vuepress/dist`
`python3 -m http.server 80`
If the port 80 is already used, change it appropriately. 
3. Now you can go to your browser and browse to `locahost:80` (or another port if you have chosen to in the last step)
