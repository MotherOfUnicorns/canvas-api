# What programming languages am I allowed to use?

<p>We do not put any restrictions on the programming languages that you use for this course. We do <i>not</i> test your programming skills and we do <i>not</i> require you to hand in any code files or documentation. In this course, as is the case for many fields of research these days, programming is a supportive tool. It helps you to grasp certain definitions/concepts better, and it allows you to perform larger calculations that you would not be able to do by hand.</p>
<p>It does not matter if you use Java, C, Haskell, Python, Ruby, Excel, Mathematica, Rust, LaTeX (hey, <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Articles/LaTeX_is_More_Powerful_than_you_Think_-_Computing_the_Fibonacci_Numbers_and_Turing_Completeness">it's Turing complete</a>), bash, or <a href="http://www.dangermouse.net/esoteric/piet.html">Piet</a>. As long as you are able to process input files in plaintext format, and get numerical/textual output. The output is all that matters.</p>
<p>If you have little or no programming experience, we advise you to write your programs in Python. We will provide you with python code stubs (starter files) that take care of the not-so-interesting parts for you: reading input files, storing their contents in arrays or other data structures, etc. That allows you to focus on the mathematically interesting parts of the program you are writing.</p>
