<p>We saw how to construct <i>binary</i> Huffman codes. We can also generate Huffman codes for larger alphabets, resulting in ternary, quaternary, or, more generally, <span style="color: #bc0031;"><strong>\(d\)-ary Huffman codes</strong></span>.</p>

<h4 style="color: #2d3b45;"><strong>Example: Ternary Huffman code</strong></h4>
We build a Huffman code with the alphabet \(\{0,1,2\}\) for the same distribution as in the previous example.

<p>Now, use the above procedure to construct a ternary code for the source \(P_X\) with \(\mathcal{X} = \{a,b,c,d,e,f\}\) and \(P_X(a) = P_X(b) = 0.25\), \(P_X(c) = 0.2\), \(P_X(d) = P_X(e) = P_X(f) = 0.1\). Can you find another code with a smaller average codeword length?</p>

<p>We have to be careful, because with an alphabet size of greater than 2, the above procedure does not always give an optimal code! In fact, a \(d\)-ary code is only optimal if \(|\mathcal{X}|\) is of the form \(k(d-1)+1\) for some \(k \in \mathbb{N}\). This ensures that at every step, we can combine exactly \(d\) symbols to use the alphabet at full capacity. The ternary code in the example above is optimal because \(|\mathcal{X}| = 5 = 2(3-1) + 1\), but the code you constructed in the exercise is not. To remedy this, one can add one or more `dummy' symbols to the source (each with probability zero) until an appropriate size of \(\mathcal{X}\) of the form \(|\mathcal{X}| = k(d-1)+1\) for some \(k \in \mathbb{N}\) is reached. The codewords for those dummy symbols are discarded at the end. It turns out that Huffman codes indeed have optimal code length (see <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/book/10.1002/0471200611" target="_blank">Cover/Thomas</a>, Section 5.8)</p>
