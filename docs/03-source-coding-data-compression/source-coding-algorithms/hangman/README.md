<p>Play the following game, try to complete at least 5 sentences!</p>
<p>If you are tired of it, you can <a href="https://esc.fnwi.uva.nl/blend/information-theory/interactive-graphs/hangman/hangman-result.php">look at the stats</a>, but it's going to spoil all the fun for playing. Clearly, the number of tries for letters depends heavily on the context! Therefore, the distribution of letters changes a lot with context, so Huffman codes are not well-suited for this purpose.</p>
<p>Thanks a lot to<span> </span><a href="http://www.uva.nl/en/profile/r/u/h.rutjes/h.rutjes.html">Huub Rutjes</a> for making the game!</p>
