<p>The following general law states that if we sample several times from the same distribution, the average converges (in probability) to the expected value of the distribution.</p>

<h4 style="color: #bc0031;"><strong>Theorem: Weak Law of Large Numbers</strong></h4>
Let \(X_1, X_2, \ldots\) be real i.i.d. random variables with mean \(\mu = \mathbb{E}[X_i]\) and variance \(\sigma^2 = \mathbb{E}[(X_i - \mu)^2] &lt; \infty\). Define the random variables \[ S_n := \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n X_i. \] Then \(S_n \xrightarrow{p} \mu\), where we interpret \(\mu\) as the constant random variable that is \(\mu\) with probability 1.</div>
