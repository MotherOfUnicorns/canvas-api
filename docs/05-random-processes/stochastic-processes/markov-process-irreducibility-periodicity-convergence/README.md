<p>Every time-invariant Markov process has a stationary distribution, but it might not be unique, and the process might never reach the stationary distribution. For uniqueness and convergence, we need additional requirements on the Markov process.</p>

The paths from state \(\texttt{b}\) to itself are all of even length, as are the paths from state \(\texttt{c}\) to itself. A typical run of this process might look like \( \texttt{aaaaabcbcbcbc} \); the period 2 is clearly visible in this run.

<h4 style="color: #bc0031;"><strong>Proposition</strong></h4>
If a time-invariant Markov chain is finite-state, irreducible and aperiodic, then there exists a unique stationary distribution. Moreover, from any initial distribution, the distribution of \(X_n\) tends to the stationary distribution as \(n \to \infty\).

Consider again the process of <a title="Markov Processes: Time Invariance, Finite State" href="https://canvas.uva.nl/courses/2205/pages/markov-process-time-invariance-finite-state-transition-matrix#example2" data-api-endpoint="https://canvas.uva.nl/api/v1/courses/2205/pages/markov-process-time-invariance-finite-state-transition-matrix%23example2" data-api-returntype="Page">Example 2</a>. This process does have a stationary distribution, because it is finite-state, irreducible and aperiodic. Let \(\mu_{\texttt{a}}\) denote the probability of observing an \( \texttt{a} \) in the stationary distribution, and \(\mu_{\texttt{b}}\) the probability of observing a \( \texttt{b} \). Then the stationary distribution must satisfy the following set of equations: \begin{align*} \mu_{\texttt{a}} &amp;= 0.7 \mu_{\texttt{a}} + 0.5 \mu_{\texttt{b}},\\ \mu_{\texttt{b}} &amp;= 0.3 \mu_{\texttt{a}} + 0.5 \mu_{\texttt{b}},\\ \mu_{\texttt{a}} + \mu_{\texttt{b}} &amp;= 1. \end{align*} Solving this set of equations gives the stationary distribution \(\mu_{\texttt{a}} = 0.625\) and \(\mu_{\texttt{b}} = 0.375\). This outcome matches our observations in the figure below. The starting distribution is irrelevant, because in the limit, the stationary distribution is reached. The following plot exemplifies this for three different starting distributions (\(P_{X_1}(\texttt{a}) = 0\), \(P_{X_1}(\texttt{a}) = 0.3\), and \(P_{X_1}(\texttt{a}) = 1\)).<br><img src="/docs/public/img/413834?verifier=vLAxi2qrKRG7zD7ArD0hyCZpHeNiFxckY59S5ULQ" alt="RandomProcesses.png" width="500" height="403" data-api-endpoint="https://canvas.uva.nl/api/v1/courses/2205/files/413834" data-api-returntype="File">
