<p><strong>Goal for moderators:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> every student who is present at the session understands how to solve the problem. In other words, transfer your understanding and knowledge of the problem to the audience "through" the presenter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tips for moderators:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides preparing a written “perfect solution” during the work session, also think about the following questions: What is “the point” of the exercise? Are there different solutions possible? What are the possible obstacles that (other) students might encounter? Discuss the answers to these questions with the teacher during the work session as well.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Slow down presenters if they are moving too fast.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Try to ask clarifying questions on the way.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep an eye on time (e.g. by stopping students early enough if you see that the presentation is not going in the right way).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the presenters are stuck, ask them the right questions to help them on their way, or give them small hints. Do not take over the presentation by giving away the full solution immediately.</span></li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tips for presenters:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When preparing the exercise, think about which things you want to write down on the board, and which things you only want to talk about. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is a good idea to quickly recap what the problem is (possibly writing the essential parts on the board), but do not waste a lot of time by copying the whole exercise.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use the board, write down what you are doing. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Try to write in a readable way. Always speak out what you write, it helps to decipher handwriting.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t go too fast, make sure everybody can follow and has understood the steps so far.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even as speaker, ask whether the audience has understood and could follow your explanations. How many have had the same solution?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t be afraid of making pauses and asking questions.</span></li>
</ul>
